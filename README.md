# aniumbott-hashnode

## About
This is a archive for media used in the aniumbott blog on hashnode. It is used to set up a static link for media files. It uses the GitHub pages to host the files. I have set up a home page to acess all the files present in the repo.

## Usage
- Add/create the folder/file in the repo and then update the [mapping.json](mapping.json) with the following command.

```python
python generate-mapping.py ./ 
```
- The file will be automatically listed to the home page. Now the static link to that media can be accessed easily.
